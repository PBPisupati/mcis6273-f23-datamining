# My Semester Goals in Data Mining

- Through this course, I like to learn and understand deeply **The concepts of data mining and algorithms**.

- I would like to practice thoroughly the concepts and apply the *data preprocessing and model evaluation* effectively.

- By the end of this course I would like to gain hands-on experience in the range of data mining algorithms, such as decision trees, 
  clustering, association rule mining, and neural networks.
